An extension [array](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/extending.html) implementation for pandas to support sparse arrays using the [sparse](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html) module.

Inspired by the IPArray implementation from [cyberpandas](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/cyberpandas). Work in progress - at this moment 69 of the 86 Pandas interface tests are passing while 17 are failing.
